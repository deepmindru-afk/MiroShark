"""Lightweight *"what just completed in the last hour?"* activity feed.

Every prior discovery surface in this codebase answers a different
shape of that question. ``GET /api/simulation/public`` is the full
filterable gallery (pagination, search, sort, the kitchen sink).
``GET /api/feed.rss`` + ``GET /api/feed.atom`` are subscription-style
syndication feeds for RSS / Atom readers. ``GET /api/status.json`` is
a liveness probe (queue depth, completed_24h, last_completed_at) but
not a per-sim stream.

None of them answer the polling-loop question integrators actually
ask: *"give me the N most recent completions in a single small JSON
payload, no auth, no gallery framing, fast cache."* That's the surface
this module builds.

The route handler at ``GET /api/activity.json`` reads from here.
Consumers — Aeon's push-recap skill checking what completed since the
last run, Capacitr / AntFleet polling their batch outcomes, status
dashboards rendering a *"recent runs"* strip, social bots that
auto-post when a sim finishes — all consume the same envelope.

Design notes
------------

* **Same publish gate as every other platform-stats surface.** Only
  ``is_public == True`` AND ``status == "completed"`` sims appear. The
  feed is unauthenticated (built for keyless polling), so the
  publish gate keeps the surface from leaking private corpus volume
  to anonymous callers — every sim a consumer reads is one the
  operator already toggled public on the gallery.

* **Sorted by ``completed_at`` descending.** ``completed_at`` is taken
  from ``state.json.updated_at`` — the timestamp ``simulation_runner``
  writes on the terminal-state transition — falling back to
  ``created_at`` for older sims whose updated_at predates the
  completion-timestamp instrumentation. Lexicographic ISO-8601
  compare; sims without any usable timestamp are skipped from the
  ordering (they'd otherwise float arbitrarily on a stable sort).

* **Signal fields derived, not stored.** ``direction``,
  ``confidence_pct``, ``quality_health`` come from
  :mod:`signal_service.compute_signal` over the same final-round
  belief split the per-sim ``signal.json`` surface uses. A sim's
  ``direction`` here matches its per-sim signal byte-for-byte. The
  trajectory walk mirrors ``platform_stats`` / ``project_stats`` /
  ``batch_status`` so all four surfaces report the same answer for
  the same sim.

* **``total_rounds`` is the trajectory length** — the same value
  ``peak_round.total_rounds`` and ``batch_status.total_rounds`` use.
  Walked once alongside the belief positions so the scan stays a
  single pass per sim.

* **``scenario_title`` is truncated.** The scenario text lives in
  ``simulation_config.json`` as ``simulation_requirement`` (often a
  full paragraph) — same source ``GET /api/simulation/<id>/clone.json``
  reads. Truncated to ``SCENARIO_TITLE_MAX_CHARS`` characters with a
  trailing ellipsis on overflow so the activity payload stays tight
  for status-dashboard layouts; full scenario text remains available
  on the per-sim surfaces.

* **``limit`` is clamped, not rejected.** The query param accepts any
  positive integer; values below ``MIN_LIMIT`` clamp up, values above
  ``MAX_LIMIT`` clamp down. Non-numeric or absent → ``DEFAULT_LIMIT``.
  This matches the gallery API posture (loose clamps over hard
  errors) and prevents a polling loop with a typo'd param from 400-ing.

* **One scan, no in-process cache.** The route handler sets a 30-second
  HTTP ``Cache-Control``, which is the only smoothing. An in-process
  cache would either make the *"recent completions"* number stale
  (defeating the polling use case) or require invalidation hooks in
  every code path that finishes a sim. The HTTP cache absorbs the
  polling load on its own.

* **Stdlib only.** ``os`` + ``json``. Zero new dependencies — keeps
  the platform on its zero-new-deps streak alongside every other
  pure-data module in this tree.
